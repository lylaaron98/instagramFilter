This file contains a general description of my Instagram Filter application

=======================================================================

Further development ideas:

1) Change right image filter to RED  by pressing "R" key

2) Change right image filter to BLUE  by pressing "B" key

3) Change right image filter to GREEN  by pressing "G" key

4) Change right image filter to Grey Scale  by pressing "Left Arrow" key

5) Change right image filter to Negative Scale  by pressing "Right Arrow" key 

6) Change right image filter to Radial Blur  by pressing "UP" key 

7) Reset to original by clicking left mouse button

Additional notes:

- left clicking before applying a filter with key press causes a radial blur effect on both pictures,
 and the intensity increases as more instances of left click are applied.

- filters applied remove the round borders around the right picture
